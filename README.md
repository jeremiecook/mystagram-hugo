# Mystagram

A Instagram like theme for Hugo.

At this point, Mystagram is more a boilerplate than a theme, but is pretty simple to customize. 


## To my future self 

### Run locally

`hugo server`

Website is up on http://localhost:1313/


### Generate and publish website

`hugo`

Then commit and push to publish new content.
Website is generated in `docs` folder to match github pages requirements.


## Todo

[] Permalinks for photos
[] Font source
